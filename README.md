evermd
======
## What is evermd ?
evermd is a command line tool implemented with Python 2.X that provides a simple markdown support to [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/).        
Because of its using the [Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) lib of Python, there are something that evermd **doesn't** support:

- LaTeX expression
- code blocks specified language
- Table

Some evermd supports is as follows:

- title from h1 to h6
- italic and bold
- hyperlink
- unordered list and ordered list
- quote
- image insert
- code and code blocks without specific language
- â€¦

Hope some Geeks and Evernote fans can be involved to make evermd more and more powerful.

## Defects
There are some inevitable defects in evermd. you can read the code and propose some issues. I appreciate it when pull requests received.    
Some known defects:

- we can just create a note but we can't modify it or even sync it
- markdown -> html -> [ENML](http://dev.evernote.com/start/core/enml.php), in which `html -> ENML` process need to be improved
- the way we get the default note name need to be handled more robust
