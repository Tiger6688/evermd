evermd
======
## What is evermd ?
evermd is a command line tool implemented with Python 2.X that provides a simple markdown support to [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/).        
Because of its using the lib [Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) of Python, there are something that evermd **doesn't** support:

- LaTeX expression
- code blocks specified language
- Table

What evermd supports is as follows:

- title from h1 to h6
- italic and bold
- hyperlink
- unordered list and ordered list
- quote
- image insert
- code and code blocks without specific language
- â€¦

Hope some Geeks and Evernote fans can be involved to make evermd more and more powerful.
